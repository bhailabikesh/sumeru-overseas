                                    Our well qualified and experienced consultants and experts are assigned for the thorough inspection of the application at various stages making the process reliable
                                </p>
                                
                                <h5>Sourcing method</h5>
                                <p>
                                    Owing to our extensive client list and the nature and scale of projects we have been and are associated with, we have several candidates registering themselves with us everyday, via our online career portal, fax, e-mail or by walk in. This information is collated, sorted and saved in a professionally managed and updated databank that provides a vast source of resources that can be easily accessed.
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <p>
                                    For specific client requirements, we regularly advertise in the leading local newspapers after getting the required documents for Labour Ministry permission. Responses we receive from these exercises undergo a preliminary short listing. Candidates are then contacted and asked to come in for an assessment by our technical consultants.
                                </p>

                                <h5>Methods of authenticating applicant qualifications</h5>
                                <p>
                                    We are well networked with all the top educational institutions within the regions we source personnel form, enabling us to verify applicant qualifications. This ensures that the candidates selected based on their qualification and experience can cope with the job requirement, if not exceed expectations.
                                </p>
                                
                                <h5>Testing for Engineers, Supervisors, Foreman, Technicians & Skilled Workers</h5>
                                <p>
                                    For the above categories, we have implemented a stringent aptitude and attitude test that includes a technical questionnaire. Candidates are required to score a minimum of 75% on this test to qualify for the next round of assessment. This ensures that the candidates we select have a high level of proficiency in their respective fields, assuring clients of the quality standards we conform to.
                                </p>
                                <h5>Screening & Short-listing by Technical Consultants</h5>
                                <p>
                                    All screening and assessment for the databank or final round of interviews is conducted by our highly experienced technical consultants and if required, candidates are sent for trade-testing. Short-listed applicants are graded on their professional and general knowledge, presentation and attitude.
                                </p>

                                <h5>Final Selection by Clients</h5>
                                <p>
                                    Once candidates have been selected for the final round of interviews, their applications are presented to the client for final selection. If required, we can carry out the final selection process on behalf of the client, based on a detailed brief on the requirements from the client. Our selection process follows rigorous theoretical and practical trade tests, ensuring that candidates are qualified only on merit. Official trade test reports can also be provided if required.
                                </p>

                                <h5>Medical Examination Facilities</h5>
                                <p>
                                    We undertake conducting the necessary medical examinations for candidates and doctors are registered with medical institutions that are approved by the consulate of the country that the candidate is recruited for. This minimizes paperwork for our clients, making the recruitment process more convenient.
                                </p>

                                <h5>Mobilization Period</h5>
                                <p>
                                    A minimum of two weeks is required, to mobilize candidates after selection and receipt of visa for actual deployment. Your visit in our office for more information will be highly praised.
                                </p>
